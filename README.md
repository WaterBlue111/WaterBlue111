Welcome? I don't know. I am WaterBlue111. Nice to meet you?

Well, I'm a human being interested in some questionable things, like Fate/Grand Order.

I'm currently doing my best to learn English (I speak Portuguese), and a little bit of programming. Perhaps one day it will bear satisfactory fruit.

If you want to talk to me, use this email [emur894@gmail.com]
